command

get => expect element to be in DOM.

query => expect element not to be in DOM.

find => expect element to appear async. This is handy
when there are asynchronous updates to the DOM and we want
to wait for one of them to occur before running our assertions.

[All]
-> (exclude) expect only one match
-> (include) expecy more than one match

QueryType (what we are searching by)
-> Role (most preferred)
-> AltText (images)
-> Text (display elements)

-> Form elements
    -> placeholderText
    -> LabelText
    -> DisplayValue


not wrapped in act(...) warning => Not follow this advice.
-> The element was updated in the dom after the test was finished.
means some async update occured after the test function had already exited.

In our case, the popover disapperance is happening asynchronously which
means it was happening after the test function had completed.

To remedy this error:
-> Determine what changes are happening after the test is over (async)
-> Account for the change in test by
    ->awaiting the change and
    -> assert on it.
